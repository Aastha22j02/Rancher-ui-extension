# ui-plugin-examples
Example plugins for the Rancher Dashboard UI.

This repository contains 2 example plugins in the `pkg` folder.

|Name|Description|
|----|-----------|
|homepage|Plugin that changes the landing home page|
|new-feature|Plugin that adds a new feature to the top-level slide-in menu|

You can find the built packages for these plugins in the [releases](https://github.com/rancher/ui-plugin-examples/releases) section of this GitHub repository. These are assets named in the form `[plugin-name]-[version].tgz`.

Additionally, fake Helm charts for the plugins are published to the releases as well - these currently only contain enough metadata to test the UI Plugin catalog. These are assets named in the form `[plugin-name]-chart-[version].tgz`.

You can also add this repository as a Helm Repository in Rancher - to do this:

- Go to the local cluster, to 'Apps' and 'Repositories'
- Click 'Create' and enter a name, e.g. 'ui-plugin-examples'
- Choose Target 'http(s) URL to an index generated by Helm'
- Enter `https://rancher.github.io/ui-plugin-examples/` for the 'Index URL'
- Click 'Create`

## Building and running locally

You can build and run the plugins locally, to do so:

- Run `yarn install`
- Set the API environment variable to point to a Rancher backend
- Run Rancher in development mode with `yarn dev`
- Open a web browser to `https://127.0.0.1:8005`

Once you login, you should see Rancher load with the two plugins automatically loaded. You can edit the code for the plugins
and then should hot-reload within the browser.
